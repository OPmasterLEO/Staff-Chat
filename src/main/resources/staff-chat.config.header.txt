   This plugin *requires* DiscordSRV in order to access Discord.
   However, it will work just fine in-game regardless if DiscordSRV is installed or not.

   ---

   Installation (Discord Setup):

   - 1) Install this plugin and DiscordSRV
        Get DiscordSRV here: https://modrinth.com/plugin/discordsrv

   - 2) Add a "staff-chat" channel to DiscordSRV's config
        (in: /plugins/DiscordSRV/config.yml)

     EXAMPLE:
     EXAMPLE:    # Channel links from game to Discord
     EXAMPLE:    # Replace the "00000000000" below with your staff channel's ID
     EXAMPLE:    Channels: {"global": "00000000000", "staff-chat": "00000000000"}
     EXAMPLE:    #                                        ^              ^
     EXAMPLE:    #                         All staff chat messages will be sent to this channel.
     EXAMPLE:

     IMPORTANT NOTE:
         The channel's name can be anything on Discord (since DiscordSRV uses its channel ID) ...
         However, it MUST be called "staff-chat" in the config.
         **This is very important!**

   - 3) If you want to use team chat as well, add a "team-chat" channel to DiscordSRV's config
        (in: /plugins/DiscordSRV/config.yml)

     EXAMPLE:
     EXAMPLE:    # Channel links from game to Discord
     EXAMPLE:    # Replace the "00000000000" below with your team channel's ID
     EXAMPLE:    Channels: {"global": "00000000000", "staff-chat": "00000000000", "team-chat": "00000000000"}
     EXAMPLE:    #                                        ^              ^                 ^
     EXAMPLE:    #                         All team chat messages will be sent to this channel.
     EXAMPLE:

     IMPORTANT NOTE:
         The channel's name can be anything on Discord (since DiscordSRV uses its channel ID) ...
         However, it MUST be called "team-chat" in the config.
         **This is very important!**

   - 4) Run: `/discord reload` or restart the server

   - 5) Give staff ranks permission to use the staff chat: `staffchat.access`
        Give team members permission to use the team chat: `teamchat.access`

   ---

   This config can be reloaded in-game with: `/managestaffchat reload` or `/manageteamchat reload`
   (Be sure to give yourself permission to manage the chats with: `staffchat.manage` and `teamchat.manage`)
